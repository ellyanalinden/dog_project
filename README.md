## Project description
Building a CNN model from scratch and using transfer learning for dog breed classification

## Development Tools
* PyTorch Framework

## Result & Conclusion
1. I built CNN model from scratch following AlexNet architecture. The accuracy is 18%.
2. For transfer learning, I used DenseNet 161. The accuracy is 89%.
