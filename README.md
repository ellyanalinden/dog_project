# Project goal
To build CNN from scratch and using transfer learning to classify dogs breed

# Development Tools
PyTorch Framework

# Results & Conclusion
Scratch CNN, I followed AlexNet architecture, and the accuracy of this architecture is 18%
Transfer learning CNN, I used DenseNet 161, and the accuracy is 89%
